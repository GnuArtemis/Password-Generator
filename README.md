# Password-Generator
This website generates a random password based on certain user criteria: desired password length, as well as whether or not to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numerals, and special characters.  The password requested must be within 8-128 characters.

As of the current version, user inputs are handled through html checkboxes and number inputs, with a 'generate' button that triggers the program.
